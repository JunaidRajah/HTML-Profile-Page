                <h2 id="sum-anchor">Summary of his life until this point</h2>
                <p>A proud upright man with a chip on his shoulder, born on 15th August 1998 in Durban, South Africa.                        
                Raised by a teacher and a hairstylist, he had a solid foundation of values and beliefs to begin 
                He found his calling in the tech space as a young lad, with the humble ps2 as his gateway drug.
                The young lad started tinkering with software and the machines that ran them. He took his passion to the 
                next level when he pursued a Degree in Computer Science at UKZN. He learnt many skills he probably will never use again.
                Nevertheless, he pushed on and found himself in the realm of DVT, and endless space of knowledge and growth, where he currently resides.
